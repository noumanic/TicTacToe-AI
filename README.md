## üéÆ Game Overview

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic variant of the classic game, played on a 3√ó3 grid of smaller 3√ó3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. The objective is to win three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the larger board.

### Key Rules
- Players take turns marking spots ('X' or 'O') on small boards
- The position of your move determines which board your opponent plays on next
- If directed to a completed board, the opponent can play anywhere
- Win three small boards in a row to win the game

## ü§ñ AI Implementations

This project implements three distinct AI approaches:

### 1. **CSP Solver with Backtracking**
- **Forward Checking**: Eliminates illegal moves early in the search
- **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**: Ensures valid board states through constraint propagation
- **MRV Heuristic**: Minimum Remaining Values for optimal variable selection
- **Degree Heuristic**: Tie-breaking based on constraint involvement
- **Least Constraining Value**: Smart value ordering to maximize future options

### 2. **Minimax AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- Classic game tree search algorithm
- Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient exploration
- Configurable search depth (default: 3 levels)
- Advanced board evaluation heuristics

### 3. **Hybrid CSP-Minimax AI** ‚≠ê (Recommended)
- Combines CSP constraint propagation with Minimax search
- Uses CSP to narrow the search space intelligently
- Applies Alpha-Beta pruning on CSP-filtered moves
- Strategic move ordering for optimal performance
- Best balance of speed and intelligence

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Clean Tkinter-based interface with 800x850 resolution
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Highlighted active boards (green)
  - Color-coded won boards (Red for X, Blue for O, Gray for Tie)
  - Clear move indicators with X and O symbols
  - Bold grid separators for big boards
- **Flexible Gameplay**: Play against different AI opponents or human
- **Real-time Analysis**: Watch AI decision-making in action
- **Strategic Evaluation**: Advanced heuristics for position assessment
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth animations and instant feedback

## üìã Requirements

```
Python 3.7+
tkinter (included with Python standard library)
```

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noumanic/TicTacToe-AI.git
cd TicTacToe-AI
```

2. (Optional) Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

## üéØ Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Select your opponent (Player O) from the dropdown menu:
   - **Human**: Two-player mode
   - **Minimax AI**: Traditional game tree search
   - **CSP-Minimax Hybrid AI**: Advanced constraint-based AI (recommended)
3. Click on any valid position to make your move as Player X
4. The active board is highlighted in green
5. Click "New Game" to reset and start over

### Game Controls
- **Left Click**: Make a move on the board
- **Dropdown Menu**: Switch between AI opponents
- **New Game Button**: Reset the game

## üß† CSP Formulation

### Variables
- Each empty position on the 3√ó3 small boards represents a variable
- Variables: `(big_row, big_col, small_row, small_col)` where:
  - `big_row, big_col`: Position of small board in the large grid (0-2)
  - `small_row, small_col`: Position within the small board (0-2)

### Domains
- Available moves for the current player ('X' or 'O')
- Dynamically filtered based on:
  - Active board constraints
  - Already occupied positions
  - Won/completed board status

### Constraints
1. **Valid Move Constraint**: Moves must follow the active small board rule
2. **Occupancy Constraint**: Cannot mark already occupied positions
3. **Board Status Constraint**: No moves on completed small boards
4. **Win Condition Constraints**: Enforce winning patterns for small and large boards
5. **Sequential Constraint**: Players alternate turns (X ‚Üí O ‚Üí X ‚Üí ...)
6. **Active Board Constraint**: Next move location depends on previous move position

## üìä Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Strengths | Speed | Optimality | Search Depth |
|-----------|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| CSP Solver | Constraint awareness, early pruning | ‚ö° Fast | Good | N/A |
| Minimax | Complete search, proven optimal | üê¢ Slower | Optimal* | 3 levels |
| Hybrid CSP-Minimax | Best of both worlds | ‚ö°‚ö° Fast | Near-optimal | 3 levels |

*Optimal within search depth limits

### Performance Characteristics
- **CSP Solver**: Best for constraint-heavy positions, O(b^d) with aggressive pruning
- **Minimax**: Thorough evaluation, suitable for endgame scenarios
- **Hybrid**: 30-50% faster than pure Minimax with comparable move quality

## üéì Academic Context

This implementation addresses the following computer science concepts:

### CSP Techniques
- **Backtracking Search**: Systematic exploration of solution space
- **Forward Checking**: Early domain reduction
- **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**: Constraint propagation
- **Variable Ordering Heuristics**: MRV and Degree heuristics
- **Value Ordering**: Least Constraining Value heuristic

### Game-Playing AI
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Optimal decision-making in adversarial games
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Efficient tree search optimization
- **Evaluation Functions**: Strategic board assessment
- **Move Ordering**: Improving pruning efficiency

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Constraint-Guided Search**: Using CSP to focus Minimax
- **Multi-Strategy AI**: Combining complementary techniques
- **Adaptive Search Depth**: Dynamic branching factor control

## üìà Performance Optimizations

- **AC-3 Preprocessing**: Reduces search space before Minimax
- **Move Ordering**: Strategic evaluation for better alpha-beta cuts
- **Branching Factor Reduction**: Limits moves at deeper levels (top 5)
- **Quick Evaluation**: Fast heuristics for preliminary move assessment
- **Domain-Specific Heuristics**: 
  - Center control (small & big boards)
  - Corner positioning strategy
  - Threat detection and blocking
  - Sending opponent to won/unfavorable boards

### Evaluation Function Components
```python
- Win detection: ¬±1000 points
- Small board wins: ¬±100 points
- Two-in-a-row threats: ¬±10 points
- Center board control: ¬±50 points
- Corner board control: ¬±20 points each
- Strategic positioning: 2-5 points
```
